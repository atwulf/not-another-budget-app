Not Another Budget App!
=======================
v 0.0.2

#### What the hell am I doing...?

My goal here is not _really_ to build a budget app. True, this is a rework of some of the concepts I explored in my previous attempt at a budget app.

But my real goal here is to become a better developer. Before I started writing all this code my goal was twofold: Learn how to do decent cross-browser DOM manipulation without jQuery, and learn an app framework.

I started off by looking at Ember, Angular, and Backbone. Eventually I settled on Backbone after briefly looking at the docs and thinking, "Oh, yeah, I'm familiar with a lot of these concepts."

When I realized Backbone wanted a DOM library, that thinking quickly turned into "But I want to write vanilla JS on the DOM... Well, might as well build the whole app from scratch!"

Don't ask me how I make such big leaps so easily.

So now the goal of this project is to learn how to build an app in JavaScript without any external libraries. Why? I dunno, it's kinda fun I guess.

### Intention Setting

Ahh, something we'll be seeing a lot of in the commit logs.

For right now, I'm not really trying to maintain a bunch of documentation about this app. The above should suffice at documentation at this point, since at the time of this writing, the app is a data model and an events hub with test specs.

I will however be writing commentary in doc blocks as I code out more functionality. Feel free to follow and keep track of the [latest dist compile](dist/versions/0.0.2/budget.js) if that kind of shit interests you.
