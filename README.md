# Not Another Budget App

I originally started this as a client JavaScript app and attempted to do it without a framework.

That was a mistake.

So now out of necessity I've started over as an Express/Mongo app.

### Usage

This doesn't quite do anything yet, but here's how you can install and hack away if you so choose:

- Make sure you have MongoDB installed.
- Fork the repo and pull it down.
- Navigate to the directory and run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run debug
```

### Contributing

Moral support is always appreciated! This is a solo, personal project, and I honestly don't expect anyone to contribute.
